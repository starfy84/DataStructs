# DataStructs-Turing
All your favourite data structures remastered for Turing 4.1.1

<h2>Implementation Details</h2>

All data structures are coded entirely using the Turing programming language, developed by Holt Software Associates. Turing has no built in data structures other than arrays and barely usable flexible arrays. This repository includes many of the necessary data structures for everyday coding. With stacks, queues, and vectors, one can even find themselves coding graph theory in Turing.
